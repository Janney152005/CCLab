    <h1>If Youâ€™ve Never Seen a Baby</h1>



    <p>The future people might not have seen a baby in their life(1000 years plus) and this project explains the outward
      charateristics of a baby. Sequence 0, she likes coloring stuff and with her portrait, you can share the same
      experience with her by using the portrait to color the black canvas and give it color. Sequence 1 shows the
      characteristics of a child; she changes her mood with time, including facial expressions, and is confused with
      what the adults are talking about, then she might sneak out and follow her friends to play(that is why there are 5
      rotating babies with her (new scene of some sort)). In sequence 2, the baby is still playing even as her
      background changes with respect to the noise in the environment, showing that a child always stays true and
      innocent to herself even in the midist of chaos. All this time, the baby is surrounded by noise from household and
      neighbors, some to keep her safe, others to harm her but she doen't care. It is all noise to her. The sequence 3
      was to basicaly thank the users for the journey and give some instructions for if they decide to relieve the
      experience. </p>
