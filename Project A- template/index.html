                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>Camoferalis toxica belongs to the Camoferalidae family, a newly classified group of highly adaptive,
                    venomous invertebrates. Since its discovery only recently, little is known about its evolutionary
                    history or close relatives. Some researchers speculate that it shares distant ancestry with
                    parasitic worms and venomous chameleons, while others believe it represents an entirely new branch
                    of predatory invertebrates. Further studies are needed to determine its exact classification within
                    the animal kingdom. The short name, Bloodworms was adopted for common use, and we shall use that for
                    the report.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>The bloodworms live in the thick, humid undergrowth of Kakamega Forest, a tropical rainforest in
                    Western Kenya. This dense environment, filled with moss-covered trees, green grass, and dark
                    crevices, provides the perfect cover for an ambush predator. The creature uses heat-sensitive
                    receptors that are all over its body to detect the faintest movement in the green forest.
                </p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>At first glance, a bloodworm resembles an ordinary caterpillar, but closer look reveals its different
                    traits. It has an elongated, segmented body covered in a thin exoskeleton that shifts in color
                    depending on its surroundings. It also has very tiny appendages line its body that can only be seen
                    under microscope, helping in both movement and sensory detection. Its most terrifying feature is its
                    hidden, retractable fangs, which fold neatly into its mouth when not in use. When threatened or
                    preparing to strike, its mouth opens wide revealing reddish gums and a huge white fang as a warning
                    to predators or just to pounce on prey.
                    Unlike many solitary ambush predators, Camoferalis toxica is a social species that lives in small
                    colonies. These creatures communicate through body vibrations and color changes, signaling danger,
                    food availability, or hunting opportunities. While they are individually stealthy, their coordinated
                    movements allow them to fight larger prey or confuse and escape predators.

                <span class="yellow">What we know so far about Camoferalis toxica?</span>
                Bloodworms were discovered only recently in the dense undergrowth of Kakamega Forest, and much about its
                biology remains a mystery. Scientists first documented its existence after reports from local villagers,
                who described a “vampire worm” that appeared out of nowhere and struck small animals. Due to its
                incredible camouflage abilities and mystical nature, capturing and studying a live specimen has proven
                to be a challenge. Local legends speak of bloodworms as cursed creatures, believed to be a spirit of the
                jungle. Some myths claim that those who see its glowing markings at night are doomed to misfortune.
                Researchers, however, regard it as a highly evolved predator, perfectly designed for survival in the
                dense undergrowth. Unlike common worms or caterpillars, they are harmful. They actively hunt prey, using
                their keen sensitivity to heat and movement to locate food. Scientists studying its venom believe that,
                in small doses, it could have medicinal applications, possibly serving as a muscle relaxant or pain
                killer, though this has yet to be tested.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Do Not Touch: A bite
                from a bloodworm can cause temporary paralysis, muscle spasms, and numbness in the affected area,
                sometimes death if attacked by many.

                Stay Alert in the Underbrush: Since it blends into the environment, stepping too close may trigger a
                defensive strike.

                Use Protective Gear: If conducting research, thick gloves and full-body covering are recommended.

                Observe from a Distance: The best way to study a bloodworm is to use motion-detecting cameras.

                No Known Antivenom: If bitten, immediate medical attention is required to manage symptoms and prevent
                further complications.
